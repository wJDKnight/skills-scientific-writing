# Section Patterns for Scientific Manuscripts

Use these outlines when drafting or repairing sections. Keep order consistent between Methods → Results → Discussion.

## IMRaD Quick Inputs (have these before drafting)
- Research question/hypothesis and primary endpoint(s)
- Design and setting (trial/observational/lab/simulation), preregistration ID if any
- Population/sample (inclusion/exclusion), n per group
- Exposures/interventions/comparators and timing
- Outcomes/measures with units and how measured
- Analysis approach (model/test, covariates, corrections)
- Main results with effect sizes + uncertainty (CI/SD/SE) + p if relevant
- Approvals/data availability (IRB/IACUC/consent), code/data links

## Drafting Sequence
- Outline visuals/tables and pair each with the matching Methods/Results subsections.
- Draft order: Methods → Results → update outline → Introduction (context → gap → aim) → Discussion (finding → meaning → strengths/limits → implications) → Abstract/Title last.
- Keep voice consistent (passive acceptable in Methods; active preferred elsewhere).

## Title
- 12–16 words; mention population, exposure, outcome; avoid jargon and abbreviations unless standard.

## Abstract (structured; adapt journal headings)
- Background (1 sentence): why the question matters.
- Objective: what you tested/estimated.
- Methods: design, setting, n, key measures, primary analysis.
- Results: top-line numbers (effect size with CI; p), harms/adverse events if applicable.
- Conclusion: plain-language takeaway and implication; avoid overclaiming causality unless randomized/strongly justified.

## Introduction (context → gap → aim)
- P1: Context and importance (what is known).
- P2: The gap or limitation in prior work.
- P3: Objective/hypothesis and the specific contribution.
- Swales moves: establish territory → find the niche → occupy the niche (aims, hypotheses, key findings, value, and map of the paper).

## Methods
- Design and setting; preregistration/ethical approvals.
- Participants/samples: recruitment, inclusion/exclusion, final n per group/timepoint.
- Variables and measures: definitions, instruments, time points, units.
- Procedures/interventions: how delivered; randomization/blinding if any.
- Analysis: primary/secondary outcomes, models/tests, covariates, missing-data handling, multiple-comparison control, software/versions.
- Reproducibility: data/code availability, protocol links, accession numbers.
- Be explicit: speeds/times/temperatures, sources of materials, equipment settings; cite published methods or give full detail if new.

## Results
- Start with cohort/sample flow and key descriptives.
- Present findings in the same order as Methods/aims.
- Report effect sizes with CI and n; include direction and units.
- Reserve interpretation for Discussion; keep prose factual.
- Avoid wordy lead-ins; do not repeat data already in figures/tables.

## Discussion
- Opening: 1–2 sentences summarizing the main finding.
- Interpretation: what the finding means relative to existing literature.
- Strengths: design, data quality, preregistration, robustness checks.
- Limitations: bias, generalizability, power, measurement limits, residual confounding.
- Implications/future work: practical impact, next experiments/analyses.
- Closing: single-sentence takeaway without new claims.
- Alternative structure (moves): state major findings → explain meaning/importance and alternatives → situate in research context (compare/contrast) → note limitations/assumptions → close with applications and recommendations.

## Limitations (if separate section)
- Bullet the major limits with likely direction of bias; mention mitigations if any.

## Data/Code Availability Statements
- Specify repository/DOI/accession and license; note restrictions (privacy/DUA).

# Responding to Reviewers

Use this template for rebuttals and revision cover letters.

## Cover Letter (short)
- Thank the editor/reviewers; restate manuscript title and ID.
- Summarize key changes (1–3 bullets: major analyses, added experiments, clarifications).
- State that point-by-point responses follow.

## Point-by-Point Responses
- Use reviewer comment → response → action format. Example:

```
Comment 1 (Reviewer 2):
They asked X...

Response:
We agree and have [action]. We now clarify on p.4, para 2: “...”.

Action:
Added sensitivity analysis adjusting for Y (Fig. 2b; Methods, Analysis).
```

Guidelines:
- Be courteous and specific; avoid defensiveness.
- Quote only the necessary part of each comment; keep numbering consistent.
- If you disagree, explain evidence-based rationale and, if possible, add a check/analysis to demonstrate robustness.
- If a request is infeasible, give a brief reason (e.g., unavailable data, scope) and offer the closest feasible alternative.
- Point to exact locations of changes (page/paragraph/figure/table).

## Common Improvements to Mention
- Added robustness/sensitivity analyses.
- Clarified methods, assumptions, and definitions.
- Improved figures/tables and captions.
- Added limitations and boundary conditions of claims.

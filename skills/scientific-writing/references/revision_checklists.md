# Revision Checklists

Use these to tighten language, ensure rigor, and catch omissions.

## Clarity and Concision
- One idea per sentence; keep most sentences ≤25 words.
- Try to not use Parallel sentences (the "and") if unnecessary. 
- When you want to say things, be straightforward. make it easy to understand. 
- Smooth transition between different sentences.
- Prefer active voice except where passive aids clarity (e.g., Methods).
- Remove filler/hedging unless warranted ("very", "clearly", "interestingly").
- Define abbreviations at first use; avoid unexplained jargon.
- Keep tense consistent: past for Methods/Results, present for general truths.
- Avoid unnecessary lead-ins for citations/figures (“In Figure 1, we show …”); cite at the end instead.
- Replace multi-word phrases with shorter ones (“to” not “in order to”; “greater” not “substantially more”).
- Prefer short words and verbs over nominalizations; keep subject and verb close together.
- Do not repeat data already presented in figures/tables.

## Structure and Flow
- Paragraphs start with a topic sentence and end with a takeaway or segue.
- Results appear in the same order as Methods/aims and as figures/tables.
- Each claim ties to a specific result, table, or figure.

## Quantitative Reporting
- Every quantitative claim includes: measure, unit, n per group, effect size with uncertainty (CI/SD/SE), and p where relevant.
- Specify model/test, covariates, multiple-testing control, and handling of missing data.
- Note software/packages (name + version) for analyses.

## Reproducibility
- Methods have enough detail to replicate (equipment, settings, code steps).
- Data/code availability statements included; accession/DOI provided if public.
- Approvals/consent (IRB/IACUC/ethics) stated when applicable.

## Style and Tone
- Avoid causal language for observational designs; state association unless randomized/strongly justified.
- Attribute opinions to sources; avoid anthropomorphizing data/models.
- Keep numerals consistent with journal rules (e.g., numbers <10 spelled out?).

## Revision Workflow (macro → micro)
- Update the outline after drafting to ensure Methods/Results/Discussion align with aims and visuals.
- Macro pass: reorder for logic, delete redundancy, and ensure each paragraph has a topic and takeaway sentence.
- Work in short sections (~5 pages) to stay sharp.
- Micro pass: read aloud or backward; search for intensifiers, “this/these” without nouns, “there is/are,” long openers, and nominalizations.
- If needed, print double-spaced and scan line by line to catch awkward phrasing.

## Final Pass
- Cross-check figures/tables against text; captions define all symbols/abbreviations.
- Ensure references/citations exist for external claims; do not invent DOIs/PMIDs.
- Confirm adherence to journal word/figure/table limits and formatting.

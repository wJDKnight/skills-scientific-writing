# Concise Writing Rules

Practical guidelines for writing clear, concise scientific prose. Use these rules as guidelines, not laws—they can be broken under the right circumstances.

---
## Most important rules
- Never use ":", ";", and "—"
- One idea per sentence; keep most sentences ≤25 words.
- When revising, keep all the ideas that the draft want to express. Never delete any ideas. You can rearrange ideas to make the flow smoother.

## Rule 1: Clarity and Concision
- Be direct and straightforward; avoid the "suspense" approach—present findings early.
- Avoid parallel "and" constructions if unnecessary; they often signal two ideas that should be separate sentences.
- Ensure smooth transitions between sentences.
- Prefer active voice except where passive aids clarity (e.g., Methods); do not switch voice within the same paragraph.


## Rule 2: Identify and Stick to Your Message

Before drafting, clarify your paper's goal. Can you summarize key points in a few sentences?


**Practical tips:**
- Write a summary sentence at the top of your document
- For each paragraph, write its focal point in one sentence above it
- Ask for each section/paragraph/sentence: Does it advance the story? Is it adding value?
- If the answer is anything other than yes, edit or remove

**Important:** Don't write like a mystery novel. Give readers an early roadmap so everything fits the picture they have in mind.

## Rule 3: Get to the Point

You and your audience share a mutual goal: transferring information efficiently.

**Avoid:**
- Long-winded setups
- Extra details that don't serve the main point
- Irrelevant tangents

At best, these waste the reader's time. At worst, they confuse or cause them to stop reading.

---

## Rule 4: Keep Methods and Results Contained

Text that belongs in Methods and Results often creeps into other sections.

**Check for:**
- Methodological details repeated in Discussion
- Results rehashed in Introduction
- Manuscript framing appearing in Methods or Results

If information already exists in the appropriate section, delete the duplicate.

**Note:** Some journals place Results before Methods. In this case, giving methodological context with each result is acceptable.

---

## Rule 5: Don't Repeat Yourself (Too Often)

Redundancy undermines conciseness. Once you state something, repeat it only to add key information.

**Acceptable repetition:**
- In Conclusions, to guide reader to bigger message
- To differentiate between two approaches when describing results

**Avoid:**
- Repeating content from figures and tables in the text
- Restating the same point in different words across sections

---

## Rule 6: Avoid Unnecessary Lead-ins

Unnecessary lead-ins can double sentence length with no added value.

### Common Types to Avoid

**1. Citation references at sentence start:**
> ✗ "In a recent study, Smith et al. (2015) showed that giraffes are larger than squirrels."
> ✓ "Giraffes are larger than squirrels (Smith et al., 2015)." [6 words saved]

**2. Display item references at sentence start:**
> ✗ "In Figure 1, we show that testosterone levels were higher in birds than fish."
> ✓ "Testosterone levels were higher in birds than fish (Figure 1)." [4 words saved]

**3. Inefficient setups:**
> ✗ "If you find yourself swimming in the ocean, be wary of sharks."
> ✓ "Be wary of sharks when swimming in the ocean." [3 words saved]

---

## Rule 7: Use First-Person, Active Voice

First-person active voice is generally tighter and more engaging.

> "We collected the data this way."
> "I argue this point."
> "Our finding is interesting for this reason."

**Benefits:**
- Puts key subjects and actions at sentence beginning
- Helps get to the point quickly
- Avoids inefficient passive constructions

**Exception:** Passive voice is appropriate when:
- The action itself is more important than who performed it
- Referring to data collection you didn't perform ("Samples were collected...")
- In Methods sections where the process is the focus

## Rule 8: Remove Unnecessary Words

Two types of filler sneak into sentences:
1. Extra words that can be removed with no effect
2. Phrases that can be condensed from several words to one or two

### Qualifiers to Often Remove

Actually, basically, extremely, fairly, kind of, quite, rather, really, sort of, very

### Multi-word Phrases to Condense

| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| In order to | To |
| As well as | And |
| Both of them | Both |
| Was found to be | Was |
| Substantially more | Greater |
| In spite of the fact | Although |
| There is no doubt that | Clearly |
| Around the world | Worldwide / global |
| A recent study has shown | A recent study showed |
| In the paper, the conclusion is that | We conclude that |

### Transitions

Remove extraneous transitions and combine sentences where possible:

> ✗ "Moreover, we show that sharks are larger than otters. Thus, sharks should be considered in global management plans. Finally, sharks also swim faster than otters."

> ✓ "We show that sharks are larger than otters and should be considered in global management plans. Sharks also swim faster than otters."

## Rule 9: Simplify Your Language

You don't need complicated words to write well. They take up space, waste time, and may cause misinterpretation.

**Use the smallest word that does the job:**

| Complex | Simple |
|---------|--------|
| utilize | use |
| demonstrate | show |
| facilitate | help |
| implement | do / start |
| methodology | method |
| approximately | about |
| subsequently | then / later |
| terminate | end |
| endeavor | try |
| commence | begin / start |

## Rule 10: Seek and Embrace Feedback

Diagnosing issues in your own writing is difficult. Good feedback is as important as the writing itself.

**For conciseness feedback:**
- Ask reviewers to look for areas to condense
- If working under a word limit, remind readers of the target length
- Request they note where rephrasing or removing content would help

**Three recommendations:**
1. **Send to critical readers** - "Looks great!" messages don't improve your writing
2. **Take feedback graciously** - People are spending their time to help you
3. **Take feedback seriously** - Be humble; disagreements about wording are common, but don't dismiss input outright

**Note:** If feedback identifies a problem, the critic is likely right that something is amiss. However, they may not be right about how to fix it—trust your intuition when you're unsure.

## Caution: Don't Over-condense

It's easy to condense into unclarity. By cutting too many words and losing key information, you create one problem while fixing another.

**The key:** Tighten your writing while keeping core ideas intact.

Writing concisely is not binary (success/failure). It's a question of degree. Strive to do it well while recognizing you must eventually stop somewhere.

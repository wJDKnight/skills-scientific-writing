# Outline Evaluation Checklist

Use this checklist to evaluate whether a user's outline is reasonably complete and well-structured. Not every outline needs every element—use judgment based on paper type and stage of development.

## Level 1 Outline (Initial Ideas)

The outline should address these fundamental questions. Missing one or two is acceptable if the writer is early in the process.

| Element | Question | Priority |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Topic | What is the topic of my paper? | Essential |
| Importance/Stakes | Why is this topic important? Why should readers care? | Essential |
| Research Question | What specific question am I trying to answer? | Essential |
| Hypothesis | How could I formulate my hypothesis or main claim? | Important |
| Results | What are my results (include visuals)? | Important |
| Major Finding | What is my major finding? | Important |

**Evaluation**: If Topic, Importance, and Research Question are missing, encourage the writer to address these before proceeding. Other elements can be developed as the outline expands.

## Level 2 Outline (IMRaD Structure)

Once Level 1 is reasonably complete, the outline should be organized into sections. Not all elements are required for every paper type.

### Introduction Section

| Element | Question | Priority |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Context | Why is your research important? What is the broader context? | Essential |
| Background | What is known about the topic? | Essential |
| Gap/Niche | What gap or limitation exists in current knowledge? | Essential |
| Objectives | What are your objectives? | Essential |
| Hypotheses | What are your hypotheses? | Important (if applicable) |
| Stakes | What are the implications if your question is answered? | Recommended |

### Materials and Methods Section

| Element | Question | Priority |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Design | What was the design of your research? | Essential |
| Subjects/Samples | Who/what were the subjects of your study? | Essential |
| Procedure | What procedure did you follow? | Essential |
| Materials | What materials did you use? | Important |
| Analysis | How did you analyze the data? | Important |

### Results Section

| Element | Question | Priority |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Main Results | What are your most significant results? | Essential |
| Supporting Results | What are your supporting results? | Recommended |
| Visuals | What figures/tables will you include? | Recommended |

### Discussion and Conclusions Section

| Element | Question | Priority |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Major Findings | What are the study's major findings? | Essential |
| Interpretation | What do the findings mean? | Essential |
| Significance | What is the significance/implication of the results? | Essential |
| Limitations | What are the limitations? | Recommended |
| Future Directions | What are the next steps or implications for future research? | Optional |

## Additional Elements to Consider

From scholarly writing best practices, consider whether the outline addresses:

| Element | Description | When Needed |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Main Claim/Thesis | The central point you are trying to convince readers of | Always helpful to articulate |
| Evidence Strategy | What types of evidence will support your claims? | When planning data presentation |
| Research Context | How does this fit with other scholars' work? | For literature-heavy papers |
| Methodology Justification | Why this approach? | When methods are novel or contested |
| Audience | Who is the intended reader? | Helps focus content and language |

## ABT Framework (And, But, Therefore)

A well-structured outline often follows the ABT pattern:

- **And**: What is known (context + background)
- **But**: What is the problem/gap (the conflict)
- **Therefore**: What we did and found (your contribution)

Check if the outline has a clear narrative arc from context → problem → solution.

```
## Outline Evaluation

### Level 1 Completeness: [Complete/Developing/Needs Work]

**Present:**
- [List elements that are addressed]

**Missing or Weak:**
- [List elements that need development]

### Level 2 Completeness: [Complete/Developing/Not Yet Applicable]

**Introduction:** [Status and notes]
**Methods:** [Status and notes]
**Results:** [Status and notes]
**Discussion:** [Status and notes]

### Narrative Flow (ABT Check)
- Context (And): [Present/Missing]
- Problem/Gap (But): [Present/Missing]
- Contribution (Therefore): [Present/Missing]

### Recommendations

1. [Priority action to improve the outline]
2. [Secondary action]
3. [Additional suggestions]

### Overall Assessment

[Brief summary: Is this outline ready for drafting, or does it need more development? What are the key next steps?]

## Common Outline Issues

### Issue: Vague Topic Statement
- **Sign**: Topic is too broad or doesn't specify the research focus
- **Suggestion**: Narrow to specific research question, population, and outcome

### Issue: Missing or Weak Gap Statement
- **Sign**: No clear explanation of what's missing in current knowledge
- **Suggestion**: Articulate what is unknown, contested, or needs extension

### Issue: No Visual Planning
- **Sign**: Results listed without reference to figures/tables
- **Suggestion**: Identify key visuals and pair each with corresponding results (when ready)

### Issue: Weak Stakes/Importance
- **Sign**: No clear explanation of why this research matters
- **Suggestion**: Connect to knowledge gap, practical application, or theoretical advancement. Answer "So what?"

### Issue: Disconnect Between Sections
- **Sign**: Methods don't align with stated objectives; Results don't match Methods
- **Suggestion**: Ensure each objective has a corresponding method and result

### Issue: Missing Main Claim
- **Sign**: Outline lists topics but doesn't state what the paper argues
- **Suggestion**: Articulate a clear thesis or main claim that the paper will support

## Notes on Flexibility

- **Early-stage outlines** may be incomplete—this is normal. Focus on whether the core elements (topic, importance, question) are present.
- **Different disciplines** have different conventions. Some fields emphasize hypothesis-driven work; others are more exploratory.
- **Review papers** and **methods papers** have different structures than empirical research papers.
- The goal is to help writers develop their ideas, not to impose a rigid template.

# Section Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to evaluate drafts of each manuscript section. These are guidelines, not rigid rules—apply judgment based on context.

---

## Methods Section

### Required Elements

| Element | Present? | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Explicit procedure details (speeds, times, temperatures) | | |
| Materials with sources | | |
| Subject/sample description | | |
| Study design | | |
| Analysis approach | | |
| Software/versions (recommended but not always required) | | |

### Common Problems

#### 1. Missing Critical Details

**Bad Example:**
> "Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation."

**Problem:** Missing speed, time, and temperature—cannot replicate.

**Good Example:**
> "Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000g for 15 min at 25°C."

**Check for:** Procedural steps include key parameters. Not every detail needs exhaustive specification—focus on parameters that affect outcomes.

---

#### 2. Voice Inconsistency Within Paragraphs

**Bad Example:**
> "Behavioral experiments were programmed using E-Prime. We took ratings of enjoyment as patients listened to music. The preferred status was operationalized along a continuum."

**Problem:** Switches between passive ("were programmed") and active ("We took") within the same paragraph.

**Good Example (Passive):**
> "Behavioral experiments were programmed using E-Prime. Ratings of enjoyment were taken as patients listened to music. The preferred status was operationalized along a continuum."

**Good Example (Active):**
> "We programmed behavioral experiments using E-Prime. We took ratings of enjoyment as patients listened to music. We operationalized the preferred status along a continuum."

**Rule:** Choose one voice per paragraph and maintain it consistently.

---

#### 3. Insufficient Detail for Replication

**Check:** Could another researcher reasonably replicate this procedure?

If the answer is no, identify what's missing:
- Source of materials (for unusual or critical materials)
- Equipment settings (where they affect outcomes)
- Timing and sequence
- Temperature and environmental conditions (when relevant)
- Software versions (for computational work)

**Note:** For well-established methods, a citation may suffice. Only novel or modified methods require full detail.

---

## Results Section

### Required Elements

| Element | Present? | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Logical organization by subsection | | |
| Purpose of each experiment/analysis (brief) | | |
| Data with figures/tables | | |
| Effect sizes with uncertainty (CI/SD/SE) | Recommended | |
| Sample sizes (n per group) | | |
| Statistical tests used | | |

### Common Problems

#### 1. Wordy Lead-ins and Overview Sentences

**Bad Example:**
> "To show our results, we first introduce all components of the experimental system and then describe the outcome of infections."

**Problem:** Adds no information; wastes words.

**Fix:** Delete entirely and present results directly.

**Note:** Brief context-setting is acceptable when it helps the reader understand the purpose of an experiment.

---

#### 2. Unnecessary Intensifiers

**Examples to watch for:**
> "Table 3 clearly shows that..."
> "It is obvious from Figure 4 that..."
> "The results really demonstrate..."

**Problem:** May appeal to emotion rather than evidence, and add wordiness.

**Fix:** Consider removing intensifiers; let data speak for itself.

**Common intensifiers to review:**
- clearly, obviously, really, very, quite, basically, rather, fairly, virtually, essentially, interestingly

**Note:** Some intensifiers are appropriate when genuinely warranted (e.g., "significantly" when referring to statistical significance).

---

#### 3. Nominalizations (Buried Verbs)

**Examples:**
> "We tested the hypothesis that there is a disruption of membrane asymmetry."
> "In this paper we provide an argument that stem cells repopulate organs."

**Problem:** Abstract nouns ("disruption," "argument") can clutter sentences.

**Improved:**
> "We tested the hypothesis that membrane asymmetry is disrupted."
> "In this paper we argue that stem cells repopulate organs."

**Common nominalization patterns to consider fixing:**
- "provide an argument" → "argue"
- "make a decision" → "decide"
- "give a description" → "describe"
- "there is a disruption" → "is disrupted"

**Note:** Not all nominalizations are bad. Sometimes they provide useful emphasis or fit better in context.

---

#### 4. Repeating Data from Figures/Tables

**Problem:** The text restates every number already visible in the figure.

**Fix:** Highlight only the most important points; direct reader to visual for details.

---

#### 5. Methodological Details in Results

**Problem:** Results section contains extensive methodological explanation that belongs in Methods.

**Fix:** Move to Methods section; keep only brief context needed to understand the result.

**Note:** Some methodological context is acceptable, especially if the journal places Results before Methods.

---

## Introduction Section

### Three-Move Structure Check

| Move | Description | Present? |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Move 1a | Show research area is important/interesting | |
| Move 1b | Review previous research | |
| Move 2 | Indicate gap or extend prior knowledge | |
| Move 3a | Outline purposes/state nature of research | |
| Move 3b | List research questions/hypotheses | |
| Move 3c | Announce principal findings (recommended) | |
| Move 3d | State value of the research | |
| Move 3e | Indicate paper structure (optional) | |

### Common Problems

#### 1. Suspense Approach

**Problem:** Writer withholds findings and approach, expecting reader to "follow the paper."

**Fix:** Be direct—present a one-sentence summary of results and approach in the Introduction.

---

#### 2. Missing Importance Statement

**Problem:** Assumes reader understands why the research matters.

**Fix:** Explicitly state the benefit and significance of the paper's contribution.

---

#### 3. Length Issues

**Guideline:** 500–1000 words for most journals, but varies by field and journal.

**If too long:** Cut background that doesn't directly set up the gap; remove tangential literature.

**If too short:** Ensure adequate context is provided for readers to understand the gap and significance.

---

#### 4. Weak Literature Review

**Problem:** Literature is listed but not synthesized; doesn't build toward the gap.

**Fix:** Group sources by theme or argument; show how they collectively point to the gap your study addresses.

---

## Discussion Section

### Three-Move Structure Check

| Move | Description | Present? |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Move 1a | State study's major findings | |
| Move 1b | Explain meaning and importance | |
| Move 1c | Consider alternative explanations (recommended) | |
| Move 2a | Compare/contrast with published results | |
| Move 2b | Explain discrepancies/unexpected findings | |
| Move 2c | State limitations/weaknesses/assumptions | |
| Move 3a | Summarize answers to research questions | |
| Move 3b | State applications/recommendations/implications | |

### Common Problems

#### 1. Weak Opening Paragraph

**Problem:** Doesn't start with main findings.

**Good openers:**
- "Our findings demonstrate..."
- "In this study, we have shown that..."
- "Our results suggest..."

**Note:** In some cases, briefly reminding the reader of the research question before stating findings is appropriate, especially for complex studies with multiple questions.

---

#### 2. Assuming Importance is Obvious

**Problem:** Reader left to infer why findings matter.

**Fix:** Explicitly state the importance immediately after presenting findings.

---

#### 3. Missing Alternative Explanations

**Problem:** Only one interpretation offered.

**Fix:** Consider addressing alternative explanations to strengthen credibility.

**Note:** Not every finding requires extensive alternative explanations. Focus on key findings where alternatives are plausible.

---

#### 4. Ending on Limitations

**Problem:** Paper ends with problems that override findings.

**Fix:** After limitations, pivot to implications or take-home message.

---

#### 5. Voice and Tone

**Guideline:** Use active voice and first-person pronouns in Discussion to convey confidence and authority.

**Note:** Passive voice is not wrong—use the voice that best serves clarity and your discipline's conventions.

## Universal Issues (All Sections)

### Sentence-Level Guidelines

| Issue | Guideline |
|-------|-----------|
| Long sentences | Aim for variety; break up sentences over 30-35 words if they become unclear |
| Subject-verb separation | Keep subject and verb reasonably close for clarity |
| Tense consistency | Past for Methods/Results; present for general truths and established facts |
| Abbreviations | Define at first use; avoid in titles and abstracts if possible |

### Tense Guidelines

| Context | Tense |
|---------|-------|
| Describing what you did (Methods, Results) | Past |
| Statements of fact, general truths | Present |
| Well-known, commonly accepted findings | Present |
| Describing others' completed research | Past (usually) |
| Ongoing research connected to present | Present perfect |

**Example:**
- "We collected samples over three months." (past—your action)
- "DNA contains genetic code." (present—general truth)
- "No previous study has reported..." (present perfect—ongoing relevance)

### Known-New Contract

Connect sentences by beginning with known information and ending with new information.

**Disjointed:**
> "Intramembranous bones, in the cranium, are ossified from membranes. The cranial vault, facial bones, the mandible, and the clavicle are intramembranous bones."

**Connected:**
> "Some areas of the cranium are ossified from membranes and are called intramembranous bones. These bones include the cranial vault, facial bones, the mandible, and the clavicle."

### Subject-Verb Separation

Keep subject and verb close together, especially in long sentences.

**Unclear:**
> "DNA, found in body fluids (blood, saliva, urine, and semen), soft tissues, bone, teeth, nails, hair roots (nuclear DNA), and hair shafts (mitochondrial DNA), contains genetic code."

**Clear:**
> "DNA contains genetic code and is found in body fluids (blood, saliva, urine, and semen), soft tissues, bone, teeth, nails, hair roots (nuclear DNA), and hair shafts (mitochondrial DNA)."

### Quantitative Reporting

Quantitative claims should include (as applicable):
- Measure and unit
- n per group (sample size)
- Effect size
- Uncertainty (CI/SD/SE)
- p-value (if relevant to the analysis)
- Model/test used

**Note:** Not every number requires all elements. Use judgment based on the claim's importance.

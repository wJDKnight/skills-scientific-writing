# Revision Checklists

Use these to tighten language, ensure rigor, and catch omissions.

## Clarity and Concision
- One idea per sentence; keep most sentences ≤25 words.
- Be direct and straightforward; avoid the "suspense" approach—present findings early.
- Avoid parallel "and" constructions if unnecessary; they often signal two ideas that should be separate sentences.
- Ensure smooth transitions between sentences.
- Prefer active voice except where passive aids clarity (e.g., Methods); do not switch voice within the same paragraph.
- Remove filler and intensifiers unless warranted: "clearly," "obviously," "quite," "basically," "rather," "fairly," "really," "very," "virtually," "essential," "interestingly."
- Avoid nominalizations (nouns derived from verbs) paired with weak verbs ("be," "have," "do," "make," "cause," "provide," "get"). Convert them to direct verbs:
  - ✗ "We provide an argument that…" → ✓ "We argue that…"
  - ✗ "There is a disruption of…" → ✓ "…is disrupted"
- Eliminate "there is/are" constructions where possible.
- Define abbreviations at first use; avoid unexplained jargon.
- Keep tense consistent: past for Methods/Results, present for general truths.
- Avoid unnecessary lead-ins for citations/figures ("In Figure 1, we show…"); cite at the end instead.
- Remove overview sentences that add no information ("To show our results, we first introduce…").
- Replace multi-word phrases with shorter ones ("to" not "in order to"; "greater" not "substantially more").
- Keep subject and verb close together.
- Do not repeat data already presented in figures/tables.

## Structure and Flow
- Paragraphs start with a topic sentence and end with a takeaway or segue.
- Results appear in the same order as Methods/aims and as figures/tables.
- Each claim ties to a specific result, table, or figure.

## Quantitative Reporting
- Every quantitative claim includes: measure, unit, n per group, effect size with uncertainty (CI/SD/SE), and p where relevant.
- Specify model/test, covariates, multiple-testing control, and handling of missing data.
- Note software/packages (name + version) for analyses.

## Reproducibility
- Methods have enough detail to replicate (equipment, settings, code steps).
- Be explicit: include speeds, times, temperatures, sources of materials, equipment settings.
  - ✗ "Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation."
  - ✓ "Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000g for 15 min at 25°C."
- Cite published methods or give full detail if new/modified.
- Data/code availability statements included; accession/DOI provided if public.
- Approvals/consent (IRB/IACUC/ethics) stated when applicable.

## Style and Tone
- Avoid causal language for observational designs; state association unless randomized/strongly justified.
- Attribute opinions to sources; avoid anthropomorphizing data/models.
- Keep numerals consistent with journal rules (e.g., numbers <10 spelled out?).
- Use active voice and first-person pronouns in Discussion to convey confidence and authority.

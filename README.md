# Scientific Writing Skill

Structured guidance for drafting and revising scientific manuscripts, abstracts, cover letters, and reviewer responses. Use this skill when writing or editing scholarly work to keep clarity, statistical rigor, and reproducibility front and center.

## What’s Included
- `SKILL.md`: the core workflows and checklists (IMRaD outlines, drafting order, concision anchors, reviewer response guidance).
- `references/section_patterns.md`: outlines for IMRaD sections and abstracts, plus availability statements.
- `references/revision_checklists.md`: macro/micro revision passes and quantitative reporting checks.
- `references/reviewer_response.md`: templates and phrasing guidance for cover letters and point-by-point replies.

## Quick Start
1. Read `SKILL.md` for the overview and paths (draft, revise, abstract, reviewer reply).
2. Pick the path that matches your task and follow the checklist.
3. Use the references for section patterns, revision passes, and response templates.

## Thanks
